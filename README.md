# Overview

## 0. What will we learn in this workshop?
### Objective
- Learn that by the end of the workshop, you'll be able to manipulate large volumes of real data and discover valuable insights.

### Sections
- Get a basic introduction to what Pandas, Numpy and Scipy are

## 1. How do we read in data?
### Objective
- Learn to read in data from a source and get it in a form that can be manipulated and analyzed

### Sections
- how to create small, practice data sets in Python
- how to read data from a CSV file
- dataframes

## 2. What are the most common operations on the data?
### Objective
- Learn the most common, basic operations on data
- the stats function
- how to apply functions
- string methods
- understand Unix timestamps
- concat, merge, append, groupby functions

### Sections
## 3. How do we slice, dice and group data?
### Objective
- Learn to filter, group an aggregate data

### Sections
- slice Dataframes like you would a regular Python list
- filter Dataframes based on a column value, e.g. How many Reddit posts are submitted between midnight and 2AM EST?
- compute aggregate counts for different column values, e.g. how many Reddit submissions came from the NY subreddit?

## 4. How can we meaningfully analyze the data?
### Objective
- Learn to extract insights from real data and in the process become comfortable with the fundamentals of Pandas.
- Use example datasets real-world, useful and actually interesting, for example analyzing some subset of the 2.5 million Reddit posts (https://github.com/umbrae/reddit-top-2.5-million)
- This is an awesome dataset resource: http://rs.io/2014/05/29/list-of-data-sets.html

### Sections
- finding max/min values within a data set
- rank values by how frequently they occur
- normalizing data when the data is not clean
- rule out outliers
- textual search within the data
